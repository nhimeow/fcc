# Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering

```jsx
const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5,
}

class CheckUserAge extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      userAge: '',
      input: '',
    }
    this.submit = this.submit.bind(this)
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({
      input: e.target.value,
      userAge: '',
    })
  }
  submit() {
    this.setState((state) => ({
      userAge: state.input,
    }))
  }
  render() {
    const buttonOne = <button onClick={this.submit}>Submit</button>
    const buttonTwo = <button>You May Enter</button>
    const buttonThree = <button>You Shall Not Pass</button>
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Enter Your Age to Continue</h3>
        <input
          style={inputStyle}
          type='number'
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
        />
        <br />
        {this.state.userAge === ''
          ? buttonOne
          : this.state.userAge >= 18
          ? buttonTwo
          : buttonThree}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for `if/else` statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional `if/else` statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, `if/else` statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago â€” when an `if/else` statement was required, it was always outside the `return` statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

```js
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
```
